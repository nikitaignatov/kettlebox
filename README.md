# KettleBox

## Introduction
Create a device that keeps track of the kettlebell excersices automatically. The device should be integrated with existing health/fitness apps like (strava, trainingpeaks, fitbit, google fit,apple health).

## Purpose

Main puspose of the project is to have a simplified domain of "tracking kettlebell excersices" in order to learn and understand how to use accelerometer and gyro sensors. 

- Brush-up on some Math.
- Evaluation and comparison of different accelerometer and gyro sensors. 
- Theory and practical application of the different filters.
- FreeCAD - 3D modellign for the product prototypes.
- PCB design
- Bluthooth BLE, ANT+, MQTT
- Evaluation of batteries for portable projects.
